# Balanced Employee Intellectual Property Agreement  

This BALANCED EMPLOYEE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made between person named below and [COMPANY NAME], a [State of Incorporation] corporation, having a place of business at [COMPANY ADDRESS\] ("Company").

(1.0) **What is this?** This is the Intellectual Property Agreement (“Agreement”) between you and the Company. If you’ve worked in the technology space before, there’s a good chance that you’ve run across one or more of these in the past. Depending on its contents, it may have been called an “IP Agreement,” “Invention Assignment Agreement,” “Creation Assignment Agreement,” or something else. This document is the official, entire and exclusive agreement on the divide between your intellectual property ("IP") and the Company's.

(1.1) **Why is this?** In order to operate and do business, the Company needs to be clear on what IP it owns and has rights to. This is true both from an internal perspective (e.g., accounting issues, revenue recognition and the like) as well as an external one (e.g., customers want to know that the Company has the legal rights to the products and services it's providing).

The Company also believes that it's important to be clear on what it doesn't own. We don't want you looking over your shoulder every time you work on a personal project or worrying that the company will someday seize your open-sourced World of Warcraft add-ons. The Company isn't interested in misappropriating your personal work and doesn't believe that a project belongs to it simply because you happen to have used your Company laptop when developing it.

(1.2) **Read this.** Please read this document before signing it. Due to legal risk and corporate obligations, the Company cannot, by and large, negotiate the terms of this Agreement. If you feel you have a particular circumstance that keeps you from accepting these terms, please let the Company legal department know. And of course, you’re always free and encouraged to get your own legal counsel to explain anything you’re not clear on.  

**As a condition of—and in exchange for—working for the Company, you agree to the following:**

(2.0) **What the Company owns.** As between you and the company, the Company owns any IP  ("Company IP") that you are or have been involved with _as its employee_, but only under one of three conditions: The work (i) relates to an existing or future Company product or service at the time you developed. invented, or created the work, (ii) was developed for use by the Company, or (iii) was developed or promoted with Company branding or resources. "Company IP" includes concepts, designs, developments, discoveries, ideas, improvements, trade secrets, and any other original works of authorship. By signing this agreement, You grant or assign to the Company all rights and interests in all Company IP, including any Company IP that you have developed or are developing before, through and beyond the date you sign this document.

(3.0) **What the Company doesn't own.** If you work on or create IP that doesn't fit into one of the conditions listed above, the Company doesn't own it. In other words, and regardless of the computer you use, the Company doesn’t own any discoveries, developments, concepts, designs, ideas, improvements, trade secrets, or any other original works of authorship that you develop, invent or create that do not meet any of the three enumerated conditions above in Section 2.0.  


(4.0) **Works for hire.** All Company IP that you are involved with as part of your work for the Company are [“works made for hire”](http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ09.pdf) and are compensated by your regular salary or pay.

(5.0) **No conflicts.** You don’t have any outstanding agreements that would conflict with this one.

(6.0) **Your IP.** If you incorporate your own IP into a Company product or service, it's still yours, of course, but you grant the Company a nonexclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to use it without restriction.

(7.0) **IP Protection.** The Company might someday need to show the work that went into the development of a project. To help in those situations, you agree not to destroy any records you maintain relating to the development of any Company IP (e.g., email, repo, or chat threads) and, if the Company asks, to provide them. You agree to help the Company secure and defend its rights in Company IP, including after you leave the company, and you authorize the Company to act on your behalf (as your agent and attorney-in-fact) in securing all rights related to Company IP.
