#### **GITHUB INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGREEMENT**<br><br>   

(1.0) **What is this?** This is GitHub’s Intellectual Property Agreement (“Agreement”). If you’ve worked in the technology space before, there’s a good chance that you’ve run across one or more of these in the past. Depending on its contents, it may have been called an “IP Agreement,” “Invention Assignment Agreement,” “Creation Assignment Agreement,” or something else. This document is the official, entire and exclusive agreement on the divide between your intellectual property ("IP") and GitHub's.

(1.1) **Why is this?** In order to operate and do business, GitHub needs to be clear on what IP it owns and has rights to. This is true both from an internal perspective (e.g., accounting issues, revenue recognition and the like) as well as an external one (e.g., customers want to know that GitHub has the legal rights to the products and services it's providing).

GitHub also believes that it's important to be clear on what it doesn't own. We don't want you looking over your shoulder every time you work on a personal project or worrying that the company will someday seize your open-sourced World of Warcraft add-ons. GitHub isn't interested in misappropriating your personal work and doesn't believe that a project belongs to it simply because you happen to have used your GitHub laptop when developing it.

(1.2) **Read this.** Please read this document before signing it. Due to legal risk and corporate obligations, GitHub cannot, by and large, negotiate the terms of this Agreement. If you feel you have a particular circumstance that keeps you from accepting these terms, please let GitHub Legal know. And of course, you’re always free and encouraged to get your own legal counsel to explain anything you’re not clear on.  

**As a condition of—and in exchange for—working for GitHub, you agree to the following:**

(2.0) **What GitHub owns.** As between you and the company, GitHub owns any IP  ("GitHub IP") that you are or have been involved with _as its employee_, but only under one of three conditions: The work (i) relates to an existing or future GitHub product or service at the time you developed. invented, or created the work, (ii) was developed for use by GitHub (effectively anything that lives or should live in the GitHub organization), or (iii) was developed or promoted with GitHub branding or resources. "GitHub IP" includes concepts, designs, developments, discoveries, ideas, improvements, trade secrets, and any other original works of authorship. By signing this agreement, You grant or assign to GitHub all rights and interests in all GitHub IP, including any IP that you have developed or are developing before, through and beyond the date you sign this document.

(3.0) **What GitHub doesn't own.** If you work on or create IP that doesn't fit into one of the conditions listed above, GitHub doesn't own it. In other words, and regardless of the computer you use, GitHub doesn’t own any discoveries, developments, concepts, designs, ideas, improvements, trade secrets, or any other original works of authorship that you develop, invent or create that do not meet any of the three enumerated conditions above in Section 2.0.  


(4.0) **Works for hire.** All GitHub IP that you are involved with as part of your work for GitHub are [“works made for hire”](http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ09.pdf) and are compensated by your regular salary or pay.

(5.0) **No conflicts.** You don’t have any outstanding agreements that would conflict with this one.

(6.0) **Your IP.** If you incorporate your own IP into a GitHub product or service, it's still yours, of course, but you grant GitHub a nonexclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to use it without restriction.

(7.0) **IP Protection.** GitHub might someday need to show the work that went into the development of a project. To help in those situations, you agree not to destroy any records you maintain relating to the development of any GitHub IP (e.g., email, repo, or chat threads) and, if GitHub asks, to provide them. You agree to help GitHub secure and defend its rights in GitHub IP, including after you leave the company, and you authorize GitHub to act on your behalf (as your agent and attorney-in-fact) in securing all rights related to GitHub IP.
